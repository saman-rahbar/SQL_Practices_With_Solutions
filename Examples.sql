/* Question 1: 

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.


Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.


Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for
each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:*/


SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;


/* Question 2: Level of Difficulty >> Intermediate

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, 
the query should return 200 as the second highest salary.
If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

*/


SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT Max(Salary) FROM Employee);



 
/* Question 3: Level of Difficulty >>> Intermediate

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

*/

 

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
RETURN (

SELECT max(Salary)
FROM Employee Emp1
WHERE (N-1) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Salary)) FROM Employee Emp2 where
Emp2.Salary > Emp1.Salary)
);
END 


  




/* Question4 Level of Difficulty >>> Easy

The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe    |
+----------+
*/


SELECT Name as Employee FROM Employee E
WHERE Salary > (SELECT Salary FROM Employee E2 WHERE E.ManagerId = E2.Id);




/* Question 5, Level of difficulty >>> Easy


Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+

SELECT Email FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email) >= 2;


/* Question 6. Level of Difficulty >>> Easy


Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

*/

SELECT Name as Customers FROM Customers 
WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);
